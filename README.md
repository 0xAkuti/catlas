Catlas is a playful social app that lets you explore your neighborhood and the world. Snap a street cat, pin it on the map, and share the joy with cat lovers everywhere. Built for Base Batches 002: Builder Track.


## The Problem We're Solving

Today, many people spend their lives staring at screens, trapped indoors, isolated from their communities. This digital isolation is creating an epidemic of loneliness and depression. 

Meanwhile, countless street cats live in our neighborhoods, some are well-cared for by communities like those in Turkey, others struggling on their own. But everywhere, these cats could be the bridge that reconnects us all.

## Our Solution

Catlas gets people outside and exploring their neighborhoods while connecting them with cat lovers around the world. Our social app transforms casual cat encounters into meaningful community experiences.

## How It Works

Think Pok√©mon GO meets Zora, but for cat lovers. When you spot a street cat, snap a photo and upload it to Catlas. Our app instantly creates a cat profile and pins the exact location on our global map. Other users can then discover cats from around the world, "like" their favorites, and mint them as NFTs.

## Key Features
